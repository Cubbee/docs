## v1.0.4

Release date: December 9, 2021

### Improved Example DAGs

The Astronomer CLI is built to enable developers to learn about, test, automate, and make the most of Apache Airflow both locally and on Astronomer. To that end, we've updated the CLI with two example DAGs that will be present for all users in the `/dags` folder that is automatically generated by `astro dev init`.

The file names are:
- `example-dag-basic.py`
- `example-dag-advanced.py`

The basic DAG showcases a simple ETL data pipeline and the advanced DAG showcases a series of more powerful Airflow features, including the TaskFlow API, jinja templating, branching and more. Both DAGs can be deleted at any time.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed a broken documentation link and outdated description in the `airflow_settings.yaml` file, which you can use to programmatically set Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools locally.

## v1.0.3

Release date: November 5, 2021

- Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where users saw errors related to S3 in Webserver logs when running locally (e.g. `Failed to verify remote log exists s3:///`).

## v1.0.2

Release date: October 25, 2021

- Improved help text throughout the CLI

## v1.0.1

Release date: October 15, 2021

- This release contains changes exclusively related to the Astronomer CLI developer experience.

## v1.0.0

Release date: September 28, 2021

- Improvement: `astro dev init` now always pulls the latest version of Astronomer Runtime for new projects. This means that you no longer have to upgrade the CLI in order to take advantage of a new Runtime release. Note that you still need to manually [upgrade Runtime](upgrade-runtime.md) for existing projects.
- Improvement: Updated error messages throughout the CLI to be more clear and useful

- Improvement: You can now use `astro dev logs` to show logs for the Airflow Scheduler and Webserver when developing locally

## v0.2.8-beta

- Improvement: Projects created with `astro dev init` now include a README file

## v0.2.7-beta
