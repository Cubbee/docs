## Astronomer Cloud CLI v1.0.0

Release date: February 1, 2022

### Introducing the Astronomer Cloud CLI

Astronomer Cloud now offers the Astronomer Cloud CLI (`astrocloud`): a global, dedicated CLI for managing your data pipelines both locally and on the Cloud.

This new CLI tool can be installed via Homebrew and is a direct replacement to the executable CLI (`./astro`) of previous versions. Astronomer Cloud CLI commands take the form of:

```sh
astrocloud <command> # E.g. `astrocloud dev start`
```

We strongly recommend that all Astronomer Cloud users [install the Astronomer Cloud CLI](install-cli.md) and delete the executable CLI as soon as possible.

In addition to being a complete CLI tool, the Astronomer Cloud CLI includes several improvements to both local project development and Astronomer Cloud management. These changes are summarized in the following sections.

### Improved Authentication Flow

Authenticating to Astronomer Cloud via CLI consists solely of a single login via the Astronomer UI. When you run `astrocloud auth login`, your web browser automatically opens to an Astronomer UI login screen. After confirming that the login process was triggered from your CLI, you can log in as you would via web browser. And if you're already logged in via the web browser, then you are automatically authenticated via the CLI.

The token generated by these logins lasts longer than before. As long as you remained logged in via the UI, expect that you will have to authenticate via the CLI only once every few months.

### Improved Local Development

Astronomer Cloud CLI v1.0.0 includes several improvements to the local development experience:

- You can now run `astrocloud dev start` with Docker Buildkit enabled. This resolves a [common issue](https://forum.astronomer.io/t/buildkit-not-supported-by-daemon-error-command-docker-build-t-airflow-astro-bcb837-airflow-latest-failed-failed-to-execute-cmd-exit-status-1/857) where users with Docker Buildkit enabled could not run this command.
- After running `astrocloud dev start`, the CLI now shows you the the health status of your containers as they spin up.

### Additional Improvements

- `astrocloud deploy` now shows a list of your Deployments organized by when each Deployment was created.

## v1.0.4

Release date: December 9, 2021

### Improved Example DAGs

The Astronomer Cloud CLI is built to enable developers to learn about, test, automate, and make the most of Apache Airflow both locally and on Astronomer. To that end, we've updated the CLI with two example DAGs that will be present for all users in the `/dags` folder that is automatically generated by `astro dev init`.

The file names are:
- `example-dag-basic.py`
- `example-dag-advanced.py`

The basic DAG showcases a simple ETL data pipeline and the advanced DAG showcases a series of more powerful Airflow features, including the TaskFlow API, jinja templating, branching and more. Both DAGs can be deleted at any time.

### Bug Fixes

Fixed a broken documentation link and outdated description in the `airflow_settings.yaml` file, which you can use to programmatically set Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools locally.

## v1.0.3

Release date: November 5, 2021

- Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where users saw errors related to S3 in Webserver logs when running locally (e.g. `Failed to verify remote log exists s3:///`).

## v1.0.2

Release date: October 25, 2021

- Improved help text throughout the CLI

## v1.0.1

Release date: October 15, 2021

- This release contains changes exclusively related to the Astronomer Cloud CLI developer experience.

## v1.0.0

Release date: September 28, 2021

- Improvement: `astro dev init` now always pulls the latest version of Astronomer Runtime for new projects. This means that you no longer have to upgrade the CLI in order to take advantage of a new Runtime release. Note that you still need to manually [upgrade Runtime](upgrade-runtime.md) for existing projects.
- Improvement: Updated error messages throughout the CLI to be more clear and useful

## v0.2.9-beta

Release date: September 20, 2021

- Improvement: Bumped the default Astronomer Runtime version for new projects to [`3.0.2`](runtime-release-notes.md#astronomer-runtime-302)
- Improvement: You can now use `astro dev run` to run Airflow CLI commands
- Improvement: You can now use `astro dev logs` to show logs for the Airflow Scheduler and Webserver when developing locally

## v0.2.8-beta

Release date: August 31, 2021

- Improvement: Bumped the default Astronomer Runtime version for new projects to [`3.0.0`](runtime-release-notes.md#astronomer-runtime-300)
- Improvement: Updated help text throughout the CLI
- Improvement: Projects created with `astro dev init` now include a README file

## v0.2.7-beta

Release date: July 31, 2021

- Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where users could not push DAGs to Deployments on Astronomer via the CLI.

## v0.2.6-beta

Release date: July 30, 2021

- Improvement: You can now run `astro auth login` without specifying a domain (`astronomer.io` is always assumed).
