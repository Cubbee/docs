Unless otherwise specified, new clusters on Astro are created with a set of default AWS resources that should be suitable for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported cluster configurations.

## Supported worker node pool instance types

Each worker in a worker node pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astro’s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

If your Organization is interested in using an instance type that supports a larger worker size, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). For more information about configuring worker size on Astro, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment-resources.md).

:::caution

Astronomer doesn’t recommend using `t` series instance types in standard mode for production workloads, because CPU utilization for `t` instance types in standard mode can be throttled.

### Ephemeral storage

With the exception of `m5d` and `m6id` nodes, all supported node types have a maximum of 20GB of storage per node for system use only. If you need locally attached storage for task execution, Astronomer recommends modifying your cluster to run `m5d` or `m6id` nodes, which AWS provisions with NVMe SSD volumes. To utilize the ephemeral storage on these node types, have your task write data to `/ephemeral`. If your task uses the KubernetesPodOperator, [mount an emptyDir volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir-configuration-example) in your operator [container spec](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes/stable/operators.html#how-to-use-cluster-configmaps-secrets-and-volumes-with-pod) instead. See [Amazon EC2 M6i Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6i/) and [Amazon EC2 M5 Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/) for the amount of available storage in each node type.

If you need to pass significant data between Airflow tasks, Astronomer recommends using an [XCom backend](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/xcoms.html#custom-xcom-backends) such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). For more information and best practices, see the Airflow Guide on [Passing Data Between Airflow Tasks](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks).
