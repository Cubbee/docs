## Overview

Astronomer Cloud makes it easy for your team to test Airflow DAGs locally and push them to a Deployment in a Production or Development environment.

This guide explains how to deploy DAGs to a Deployment on Astronomer Cloud.

## Prerequisites

To deploy DAGs to Astronomer, you must have:

- The [Astronomer CLI](install-cli) installed in an empty directory.
- An Astronomer Workspace with at least one [Deployment](configure-deployment).
- A [local Astronomer project](create-project).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

> **Note:** If youâ€™re running the Astronomer CLI with [buildkit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) enabled in Docker, you may see an error (`buildkit not supported by daemon`). Learn more in [this forum post](https://forum.astronomer.io/t/buildkit-not-supported-by-daemon-error-command-docker-build-t-airflow-astro-bcb837-airflow-latest-failed-failed-to-execute-cmd-exit-status-1/857).

## Step 1: Authenticate to Astronomer

Once you've tested your DAGs locally, you're ready to push them to Astronomer. To start, authenticate to Astronomer Cloud by running:

```
astro auth login
```

If you created your account with a username and password, you'll be prompted to enter them directly in your terminal. If you did so via GitHub or Google OAuth, you'll be prompted to grab a temporary token from https://cloud.astronomer.io/token.

## Step 2: Push DAGs to an Astronomer Deployment

To deploy your DAGs, run:

```
astro deploy
```

This command returns a list of Airflow Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to pick one. Once this command is executed, all files in your Airflow project directory are built into a new Docker image. This includes system-level dependencies, Python-level dependencies, DAGs, and your `Dockerfile`. It does not include any of the metadata associated with your local Airflow environment, including task history and Airflow Connections or Variables that were set locally. This Docker image is then pushed to all containers running the Apache Airflow application on Astronomer Cloud, including Celery Workers.

If a deploy is triggered while a Celery Worker is executing a task and **Worker Termination Grace Period** is set, the Worker will continue to process that task up to the specified number of minutes before restarting itself. By default, the grace period is 10 minutes. For more information, read [Configure a Deployment on Astronomer](configure-deployment).

## Step 3: Validate Your Changes

If it's your first time deploying, expect to wait a few minutes for the Docker image to build. To confirm that your deploy was successful, open your Deployment in the Astronomer UI and click **Open Airflow** to access the Airflow UI.

Once you log in, you should see the DAGs you just deployed.
