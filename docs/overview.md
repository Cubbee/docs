## Overview

Welcome to Astronomer Cloud Private Beta. We're thrilled to have you onboard with us as we launch the next generation of our product. We expect our teams to be in close communication throughout the program, and this page will serve as a home for official product documentation.

To start, Astronomer Cloud Private Beta includes a game-changing deployment model that offers the self-service convenience of a fully managed Cloud service (the “Control Plane”) while respecting the need to keep data private, secure, and within corporate boundaries (the “Data Plane”).

This model optimizes for security whilst relieving your team of operational overhead. As we look beyond Private Beta to build a robust set of differentiating features, we very much look forward to hearing your feedback.

## Features

Astronomer Cloud's architecture enables a few key features, available in Private Beta:

- Support for Astronomer Cloud on AWS `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`.
- Worker auto-scaling, powered by Airflow's Celery Executor + KEDA.
- Astronomer Runtime, a new collection of Docker images set to provide a differentiated Airflow experience. Astronomer Runtime will initially support Airflow 2.1.1.
- Real-time, in-app chat support.

We will continue to make changes and release new features throughout the course of Private Beta with no expected disruption to your team.

## Program Expectations

Astronomer Cloud Private Beta partners will have early access to all product features, with the expectation that your team will provide feedback and work with us to prioritize and build the features necesssary to officially bring this product to market.

In practice, we ask for the following from your team:

- A new AWS account enabled in one of our supported regions (`us-east-1` or `us-west-2`).
- A 1-hour setup and onboarding session with our team to get an Astronomer Cluster and Deployment provisioned in your AWS account.
- A commitment to deploy real DAGs. We can work together to identify a use case.
- Weekly 30-minute check-ins to discuss your experience, get feedback, and update your team on progress.

We expect participation to extend through when Astronomer Cloud launches Limited Commercial Availability, expected in late September 2021.

## Get Started

Our team will reach out to yours to schedule an onboarding session for the initial install. From there, we recommend reading through the following docs:

- [Configure your Deployment](configure-deployments)
- [Install the Astronomer CLI (Private Beta)](install-cli)
- [Deploy Code](deploy-code)

If you have a feature request or find a bug to report, reach out to us in the in-app chat modal or drop us a note in our shared Slack Channel.

We sincerely appreciate your participation and can't wait to form an even deeper partnership with your team. Let's do this thing!
