## Overview

This guide provides instructions for how to create API keys for your Astronomer Deployments. You can use Deployment API keys to programmatically deploy DAGs to a given Deployment on Astronomer, or to programmatically update a Deployment's Airflow environment via the Airflow API.

Deployment API keys have the following properties:

- They can deploy code to Astronomer (finer-grained permissions coming soon).
- They are deleted permanently if the corresponding Deployment is deleted.
- By default, the access generated by an API key call is valid for 24 hours. If the access is used while still valid, it will continue to be valid for another 24 hours after the moment it was used.

:::info

Deployment API keys are similar in behavior and function to [Service Accounts](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/enterprise/v0.25/deploy/ci-cd#step-1-create-a-service-account) from Astronomer Cloud and Enterprise.

This guide provides steps for creating and deleting Deployment API keys.

## Create an API Key

To create an API key for a Deployment:

1. In the Astronomer UI, open your Deployment.
2. In the **API Keys** menu, click **Add API Key**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/add-api-key.png" alt="Add API Key button" />
    </div>

3. Give the key a name and description, then click **Create API Key**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/create-api-key.png" alt="Create API Key button" />
    </div>

From here, you can copy the API key ID and secret for use in API calls and CI/CD pipelines. Note that this is the one and only time you will be able to see the secret.

Alternatively, you can use a temporary access key. To retrieve a temporary access key, go to `cloud.astronomer.io/token` and copy the key that appears. This key is valid only for 24 hours.

## Delete an API Key

To delete a Deployment API Key:

1. In the Astronomer UI, open your Deployment.
2. In the menu for the API key you want to delete, click **Edit**:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/edit-api-key.png" alt="Edit API Key button" />
    </div>

3. Click **Delete API Key**, then follow the onscreen prompt to finalize the deletion:

    <div class="text--center">
      <img src="/img/docs/delete-api-key.png" alt="Delete API Key button" />
    </div>
